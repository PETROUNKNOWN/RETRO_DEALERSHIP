         The Challenger SRT Demon is even mightier than the Hellcat version, boasting up to 840 horsepower and exclusive drag-racing equipment. Did we mention that it can do a wheelie, too? While the limited-edition Demon went out of production after the 2018 model year, it remains one of the coolest and craziest cars to ever wear a Dodge badge. Many of its engine and transmission goodies are now available on the Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye. Still, even the most powerful pony-car competitors, such as the 650-hp Chevy Camaro ZL1 and the all-new 700-plus-horsepower Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, will be hard-pressed to match the straight-line acceleration of the Demon.The heart of this demonic Challenger is its 808-hp supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V-8. Wait, didn't we already say it makes 840 horsepower? That is correct, but only when the gas tank is filled with 100-plus-octane race fuel and the $1 Demon Crate package is added, which includes a special engine controller that helps unlock the engine's full potential. Add—or should we say subtract—numerous interior pieces to make it lighter, along with the many other weight-saving methods, and Dodge claims the Demon can cover the quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds at 140 mph. What does that mean? It's (expletive) fast, that's what.Inside, the Demon's design resembles every other Dodge Challenger model. This version, however, can be stripped down by removing the passenger-side and rear seats and swapping some luxury amenities, such as the power-adjustable steering wheel and complex audio system, for simpler alternatives. However, those who want to keep the seats so they can take their passengers for hell rides can have them added back in for just $1. The sound system and several other creature comforts—such as a power sunroof, heated steering wheel, and heated and ventilated front seats—can also be added for those who opt for the tamer package.<br>

         As a targa or a convertible, the ZR1's flamboyant bodywork clearly denotes it as the pinnacle of the Corvette lineup. Until the long-awaited mid-engined C8 Corvette arrives, the ZR1 serves as the halo car for the Chevrolet brand.Its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 pushes a fierce 755 horsepower to the rear wheels; in our testing, the ZR1 went from zero to 60 mph in 3.0 seconds. The brakes are incredibly powerful, and the ZR1 grips the road with race-car intensity. That optional wing? It provides up to 950 pounds of downforce. The automatic transmission is slow to shift, so get the manual transmission to better master this beast. Despite the ZR1's performance potential, turning the drive-mode selector to Tour results in a compliant ride that admirably soaks up bumps.Inside, the ZR1's cabin is much like lesser Vettes. There's plenty of room for two adults in seats that are wrapped in leather; aggressively bolstered sport seats are optional and also leather-wrapped. The interior isn't luxurious but its layout is simple; cargo space is generous, at least in the targa model. Touchscreen infotainment with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, onboard Wi-Fi, and a head-up display is standard while navigation remains an option. Looking for high-tech driver-assistance features? Look elsewhere, because the ZR1 offers nothing of the sort.<br>

         Doesn't matter what you call it—GT-R or, as its fan lovingly refer to it, Godzilla—Nissan's range topper is a supercar-stomping, high-tech dynamo. The 2019 GT-R has a high-performance heritage stretching back to the original Skyline GT-R from 1969. To celebrate the car's 50th anniversary, Nissan is making some tweaks to the 2020 GT-R and adding a special edition model. Nissan has also announced pricing for the 2020 GT-R; its base price has increased by nearly $14,000, to $115,235 for the Premium trim.Its 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 makes a mighty 565 hp while a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and all-wheel drive conspire to put all that power to the pavement. At our test track, the GT-R launched itself from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.9 seconds, just 0.2 second behind the Porsche 911 Turbo S we tested. The 2019 Nissan GT-R's quick steering, rigid structure, and adjustable suspension can make even amateurs feel positively heroic from behind the wheel. Want more? Check out the track-ready NISMO-tuned variant with 600 horsepower. The ride is firm but not punishing and, thanks to active sound cancellation, the thrum of the GT-R's engine doesn't punish your ear drums when cruising on the highway.The front seats are plenty roomy but the rear seats are places only small children could find comfortable. The interior is nicely appointed and offers a host of standard features, but those seeking a high-end interior such as those of the Audi R8 or the Mercedes-AMG GT will be disappointed. Leather-and-suede-covered seats are standard, as is an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with navigation and Apple CarPlay capability. You won't find any of Nissan's driver-assistance features here, but to be fair, those types of electronics aren't commonplace in most of the GT-R's rivals, either.<br>

         As the most powerful and quickest factory Mustang ever, the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 blends modern sports-car performance with iconic muscle-car presence. It builds on the same racetrack-capable chassis as the excellent Ford Mustang Shelby GT350, with an additional 234 horsepower that lends it credibility at the drag strip as well. The GT500 makes speed effortlessly with equal parts brains and brawn, including a supercharged V-8 that hammers out 760 horsepower, a quick-shifting seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, and magnetorheological dampers. Optional carbon-fiber wheels, track tires, and aerodynamic aids are available for drivers looking to get the most out of this monster Mustang. The Shelby GT500 sits at the pinnacle of American muscle cars alongside the 650-hp Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and the 797-hp Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye.Every Shelby GT500 comes with an 8.0-inch touchscreen running Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability. The standard setup also includes SiriusXM satellite radio, a CD player, two USB ports, and nine speakers. Ford's own navigation and a 12-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system are available as part of the $3000 Technology package. Every GT500 has the ability to be locked and unlocked from the FordPass phone app and to serve as a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot with a data subscription.<br>

         Like a Subaru WRX, but with more of everything. The Subaru WRX STI has more horsepower, bigger aerodynamic features, beefier brakes, and a more extreme race-tuned suspension than the already outlandish WRX it’s based upon. Anyone who likes their enchiladas on the mild side, stop reading right now. This Subie is a full-bore, five-alarm, barely civilized race car that’s somehow legal for road use. In other words, it’s one heck of a lot of fun! Within its class, however, the WRX STI lacks the refinement of competitors like the Honda Civic Type R, the Ford Focus RS, and the Volkswagen Golf R.The WRX STI scorches its way down the road courtesy of a turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder that sends 305 horsepower and 290 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels. Offered only with a six-speed manual, you can forget about smooth and refined performance. This Subaru has loads of turbo lag and demands your full concentration all the time, and the firm suspension keeps excessive body motion in check at the expense of ride comfort. That’s perfect if on every morning commute you like to pretend you’re a rally legend gunning for glory on a narrow tree-lined trail. It’s tiring, yes, but also outrageously entertaining.The WRX STI comes with a 7.0-inch touchscreen that uses Subaru’s Starlink infotainment software. This is an intuitive system, even though it lacks some of the bells and whistles found in rivals. Every STI comes with Bluetooth, satellite radio, and a number of smartphone apps that can be integrated into the touchscreen controls. There’s no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, though extras like navigation and a Harman Kardon audio system are optional. And to make certain your smartphone is as charged up as the STI’s driving manners, there are two USB ports.<br>
